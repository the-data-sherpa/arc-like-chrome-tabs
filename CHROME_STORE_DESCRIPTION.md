If you find yourself drowning in dozens of open tabs, losing track of important pages, or struggling to organize your research and projects, Tabula is the solution you've been looking for.

WHAT IS TABULA?

Tabula is a powerful Chrome extension that replaces the traditional horizontal tab bar with a beautiful vertical sidebar. This sidebar gives you a complete overview of all your tabs at a glance, making it easier to find what you need, organize your work, and stay productive. But Tabula goes far beyond just displaying tabs vertically - it provides a complete tab management system with workspaces, pinned tabs, and favorites.

WHY YOU NEED TABULA

Do you recognize any of these problems? You have so many tabs open that you can't read the tab titles anymore. You lose important tabs when you accidentally close a window. You struggle to keep work tabs separate from personal browsing. You waste time searching through dozens of tabs to find the one you need. You bookmark pages but never remember to use them. If any of these sound familiar, Tabula will change how you browse the web.

Tabula solves these problems by giving you powerful tools to organize your browsing. Create separate workspaces for different projects. Pin important tabs so they're always accessible. Build a favorites bar for your most-used sites. Organize everything into folders. Switch between projects instantly. Tabula makes browsing organized, efficient, and enjoyable.

KEY FEATURES

WORKSPACES - ORGANIZE BY PROJECT OR CONTEXT

The core feature of Tabula is workspaces. Think of a workspace as a separate container for tabs related to a specific project, task, or context. Create a workspace for "Work Projects", another for "Research", and another for "Personal". Each workspace maintains its own set of tabs completely isolated from others.

When you switch workspaces, Tabula automatically closes tabs from the previous workspace and opens tabs from the new one. This means you can have dozens of tabs open for work, switch to your personal workspace with just a few tabs, and then switch back to work - all your work tabs are exactly as you left them. No more mixing work and personal browsing. No more losing track of which tabs belong to which project.

Creating a workspace is simple - just click the plus button next to the workspace dropdown and give it a name. You can create as many workspaces as you need. Rename them anytime by right-clicking the workspace dropdown. Delete workspaces when projects are complete. Workspaces make it easy to keep your browsing organized and focused.

PINNED TABS - NEVER LOSE IMPORTANT PAGES

Pinned tabs are one of Tabula's most powerful features. When you pin a tab, Tabula remembers the exact URL where you pinned it. Even if you navigate to different pages in that tab, close it, or switch workspaces, when you reopen the pinned tab it will always return to the original URL where you pinned it.

This is incredibly useful for research, development, or any work where you need to return to specific pages. Pin your project documentation, reference materials, or important tools. They'll always be there, always at the right URL, no matter how much you browse in between.

Pinned tabs appear in the sidebar with a visual indicator showing whether they're currently open. Click a pinned tab to open or activate it. Use the minus button to close the Chrome tab while keeping it pinned. Use the X button to remove it from your pinned tabs entirely. Pinned tabs are workspace-specific, so each workspace can have its own set of pinned tabs.

FOLDERS - ORGANIZE PINNED TABS

As your list of pinned tabs grows, organization becomes important. Tabula lets you create folders within your pinned tabs section. Group related tabs together - put all your development tools in one folder, documentation in another, and reference materials in a third.

Folders are collapsible to save space. But here's a smart feature - even when a folder is collapsed, if it contains open tabs, those tabs will still be visible below the folder. This means you can keep folders collapsed for organization while still seeing which tabs are active. Click a folder header to expand or collapse it. Right-click to rename or delete folders.

FAVORITES BAR - QUICK ACCESS TO YOUR MOST-USED SITES

At the top of the Tabula sidebar is the favorites bar. This displays up to 8 of your most important sites as square favicon buttons. Favorites are global - they persist across all workspaces, so you always have quick access to your most-used sites no matter which workspace you're in.

Adding a site to favorites is easy - right-click any tab and select "Add to Favorites". The site appears in the favorites bar with its favicon. Click a favorite to open or activate it. Favorites work just like pinned tabs - they remember their saved URL and always return to it when opened.

The favorites bar uses a clean, modern design with square buttons showing site favicons. Active favorites are highlighted, and open favorites have a blue border indicator. The favorites bar is perfect for sites you use constantly - email, calendar, project management tools, or any site you visit multiple times per day.

IMPORT BOOKMARKS - BRING YOUR EXISTING ORGANIZATION

If you already have bookmarks organized in Chrome, Tabula can import them. Click the import button and select your Chrome bookmarks HTML file. Tabula will parse your bookmarks and give you options for how to import them.

You can create new workspaces from top-level bookmark folders, import everything into your current workspace while preserving folder structure, or import all bookmarks as favorites. Tabula preserves your existing organization, so you don't have to start from scratch.

DRAG AND DROP - EASY REORGANIZATION

Tabula makes it easy to reorganize your tabs. Drag any tab to move it between workspaces, folders, or favorites. Drag tabs to reorder them within a list. Drag tabs into folders or out of folders. The drag and drop interface is intuitive and makes organizing your tabs effortless.

VISUAL INDICATORS - ALWAYS KNOW WHAT'S ACTIVE

Tabula uses visual indicators to help you understand the state of your tabs at a glance. The currently active tab is highlighted. Open tabs have visual indicators. Pinned tabs show whether they're open or closed. Folders show how many tabs they contain. These visual cues make it easy to understand your browsing state without reading through lists.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUT - INSTANT ACCESS

Press Ctrl+Shift+E on Windows or Linux, or Cmd+Shift+E on Mac, to instantly toggle the Tabula sidebar. This keyboard shortcut makes it easy to access your organized tabs without reaching for the mouse. The sidebar opens and closes smoothly, so you can quickly check your tabs and get back to browsing.

RIGHT-CLICK CONTEXT MENUS - POWERFUL OPTIONS

Right-click any tab in the sidebar to access powerful options. Pin tabs to the current workspace. Add tabs to favorites. Move tabs to folders. Update the saved URL for pinned tabs. Close tabs. Remove tabs from lists. These context menus give you quick access to all of Tabula's features without cluttering the interface.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY

Tabula respects your privacy. All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's local storage. Tabula never sends any data to external servers. There's no tracking, no analytics, no data collection. Your browsing stays private and secure. Tabula only requests the permissions it needs to function - access to tabs for management, storage for saving your organization, context menus for right-click options, and the side panel for the sidebar interface.

PERFECT FOR

Tabula is perfect for anyone who manages multiple tabs, but it's especially useful for:

Researchers who need to keep track of many sources and references. Create a workspace for each research project, pin important papers and articles, and organize everything into folders. Switch between projects instantly without losing your place.

Developers working on multiple projects. Keep development tools, documentation, and project resources organized in separate workspaces. Pin important reference pages that you need to return to frequently. Use folders to organize tools by category.

Students managing coursework and research. Create workspaces for different classes or subjects. Pin assignment pages, course materials, and research sources. Keep everything organized and easy to find.

Professionals juggling multiple clients or projects. Separate work by client or project using workspaces. Pin client portals, project management tools, and important documents. Switch between clients instantly without mixing tabs.

Anyone who wants better tab organization. If you regularly have more than 10 tabs open, Tabula will transform your browsing experience. The vertical sidebar gives you a complete overview, workspaces keep things organized, and pinned tabs ensure you never lose important pages.

TIPS FOR GETTING THE MOST OUT OF TABULA

Use workspaces to separate different types of work. Create a workspace for each major project, client, or area of focus. This keeps your tabs organized and makes it easy to switch contexts.

Pin important reference pages. If you frequently return to the same documentation, tools, or resources, pin them. They'll always be accessible and always return to the right URL.

Use folders to organize large numbers of pinned tabs. Group related tabs together - development tools, documentation, reference materials. Folders keep your pinned tabs organized and easy to navigate.

Take advantage of favorites for sites you use constantly. Email, calendar, project management tools, or any site you visit multiple times per day belongs in favorites. The favorites bar gives you instant access.

Import your existing bookmarks to get started quickly. Don't lose your existing organization - import it into Tabula and build from there.

Use the keyboard shortcut. Ctrl+Shift+E (or Cmd+Shift+E on Mac) makes it easy to access Tabula without reaching for the mouse.

Right-click for options. The context menus give you quick access to all of Tabula's features. Pin tabs, add to favorites, move to folders, update saved URLs - all available with a right-click.
